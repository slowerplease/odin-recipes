	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p> Air fryer Buffalo cauliflower â€” a clever way to get your veggies without sacrificing that saucy flavor you love with buffalo wings. We always serve this with celery and carrot sticks and our favorite blue cheese dressing.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
		 <li>1/2 cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's)</li>
		 <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
		 <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
		 <li>1 (2 pound) cauliflower, broken into florets</li>
		 <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
		 <li>1/4 corn starch</li>
		 <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
		 <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt (such as Lawry's)</li>
		 <li>1/4 paprika</li>
		 <li>drizle of buffalo wing sauce (optional)</li>
		</ul>
	<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
		 <li>Combine hot sauce, butter and honey in a large bowl; whisk until well combined. Add cauliflower florets and stir until well coated.</li>
		 <li>Combine flour, corn starch, garlic powder, seasoning salt, and parika in a separate bowl, stirring well. Gradually sprinkle the flour mixture over the cauliflower florets, tossing until all florets are coated.</li>
		 <li>Preheat the air fyer to 390 degrees F (195 degrees C). Spray the fryer basket with olive oil spray or line with a parchment paper.</li>
		 <li>Transfer cauliflower florets to the air fryer basket in a single layer, making sure not to overcrowd the basket, so they'll crisp up and not turn soggy.</li>
		 <li>Air fry for 10 to 15 minutes, shaking the basket several times until the florets are lightly browned.  They should be crispy, but not overcooked or mushy. You may ahve to cook in batches depending on the size and brand of your air fryer.</li>
		 <li>Give the cauliflower a light drizzle of buffalo wing sauce when they come out of the air fryer, if desired. Serve with your choice of a creamy dipping sauce.</li>
		</ol>
